## AI Use

Code generated from AI models are not accepted in this project and will be rejected. This is because AI generated code does not follow the standards of copyleft and software licenses.

An [article](https://www.fsf.org/licensing/copilot/on-the-nature-of-ai-code-copilots) from the Free Software Foundation states:

```
